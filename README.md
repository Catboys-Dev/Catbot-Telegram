## Catbot - Telegram
I've made this open source as the bot has been depreciated due to lack of usage. I have removed some functions from the open source version (such as admin commands and private api endpoints and authentication methods as well as the bot API which is quite bulky and needs to be configured to work), but the code should work as is, if not, please send me an email at hello (at) kk.dev


### Quick rundown on how to install the bot:
Install requirements: pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Then you can start the bot using the included script: bash ./start.sh

If bash doesn't work, use python: python3 bot.py


## License
I have included a license file and if you do use this code, I ask that you give me proper credit and a link to my website (kk.dev) if applicable and much appreciated!
